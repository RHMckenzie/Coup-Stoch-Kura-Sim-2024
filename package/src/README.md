## Important information about JSON templates



## Individual Runs

The simulator can be invoked using `python parser.py task1.json [task2.json ...]`, where `task1.json` is a task specified from a json file (such as the one in the json templates), usually a good idea to modify the save_folder location of such things so the final data is autosaved correctly.

the resultant contents should be in the data folder

## Batch Processing

Generally it goes autorun.py -> gather_data_h5.py -> combine.py
