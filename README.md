# Coupled Stochastic Kuramoto Simulator (2024)
A short numpy vector-optimised package that simulates coupled stochastic oscillators under the Kuramoto model on a given networkX graph, also performs an efficient evaluation of relative synchrony (which I demonstrate empirically to be an upper bound on the actual relative synchrony in my undergraduate thesis).

Further instructions on running this package can be found under the "package" section

Data summaries can be found under the "data" section

The dataset is ~150GB and can be provided on request from richardmckenzie@protonmail.com
