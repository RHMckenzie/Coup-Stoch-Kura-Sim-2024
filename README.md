# A Coupled Stochastic Oscillator Simulator for the Evaluation of Relative Synchrony (2024)
A short numpy vector-optimised package that simulates coupled stochastic oscillators under both the Kuramoto and Linear (Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) models on "any" given networkX graph (although the data is targeted towards W-S small-world networks), also can perform a fast approximation of (linear) relative synchrony, which was observed to empirically be an upperbound on the stable relative (kuramoto) synchrony (or stable "relative width") in my undergraduate thesis.

Currently VERY WIP, need to finalise this.

Further instructions on running this package and the source code can be found under the `/package` section

Data summaries can be found under the `/data` folder

The actual dataset is ~50GB and can be provided on request from richardmckenzie@protonmail.com
